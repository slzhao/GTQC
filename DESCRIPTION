Description: R package GTQC streamlines a majority of the quality 
    control steps and produces a detailed HTML report on a plethora 
    of quality control metrics, thus enabling a swift and rigorous 
    data quality inspection prior to downstream GWAS and related 
    analyses. By significantly cutting down on the time on genotyping 
    quality control procedures, GTQC ensures maximum utilization of 
    available resources and minimizes waste and inefficiency.
